- 👋 Hi, I’m @NDGee
- 👀 I’m interested in website creation for musicians to sell their original music.
- 🌱 was learning html/ littl python and got an easy site together w/bio for listening to some of my tracks for free. 
- I'd like to provide samples of my songs for susequent purchase (single/lp/ep's) on the web with direct payments to my bank. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on a project to integrate automated licensing of my original music for all types of commercial users as well.  
- Plus purchases by private users. 
- I have extensive knowledge in music licensing. 
📫 If you are interested to join me and discuss in more detail you can reach me at: housepioneers@gmail.com ...
